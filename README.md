# EVPI Calculator

## Introduction

The EVPI Calculator is a web-based tool designed to calculate the Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI), a key concept in decision analysis. This project provides users with a simple interface to input their payoff matrix and probabilities, compute the Expected Value Given Perfect Information (EVGPI), Expected Value Without Perfect Information (EVWPI), and ultimately determine the EVPI.

## Features

  - Responsive design using HTML and CSS for an intuitive user experience.
  - Clean and minimalist layout for easy navigation and input.

- **Functionality**:
  - **Payoff Matrix Input**: Users can enter values into a 3x2 payoff matrix.
  - **Probability Input**: Users can input probabilities associated with each state.
  - **Calculation**: On clicking "CALCULATE," the system computes EVGPI, EVWPI, and EVPI.
  - **Results Display**: Displays detailed calculation results with clear formatting.
  - **Reset Option**: Users can reset the form to input new data easily.

- **Accessibility**:
  - Available online for easy access.
  - Compatible with modern browsers and devices.

## Project Files

The project consists of the following key files:

- **index.html**: Main HTML file containing the structure and layout of the calculator.
- **style.css**: Stylesheet for designing the user interface.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file to handle the logic for calculations and user interactions.
